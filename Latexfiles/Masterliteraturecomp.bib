abstract = {X-ray phase contrast imaging based on grating interferometers detects the refractive index distribution of an object without relying on radiation attenuation, thereby having the potential for reduced radiation absorption. These techniques belong to the broader category of optical wavefront measurement, which requires stepping the phase of the interference pattern to obtain a pixel-wise map of the phase distortion of the wavefront. While phase stepping traditionally involves mechanical scanning of a grating or mirror, we developed electromagnetic phase stepping (EPS) for imaging with compact sources to obviate the need for mechanical movement. In EPS a solenoid coil is placed outside the x-ray tube to shift its focal spot with a magnetic field, causing a relative movement between the projection of the sample and the interference pattern in the image. Here we present two embodiments of this method. We verified experimentally that electromagnetic and mechanical phase stepping give the same results and attain the same signal-to-noise ratios under the same radiation dose. We found that the relative changes of interference fringe visibility were within 3.0\% when the x-ray focal spot was shifted by up to 1.0 mm in either direction. We conclude that when using x-ray tube sources, EPS is an effective means of phase stepping without the need for mechanical movement.},

abstract = {This thesis describes the design, construction, commissioning and testing of a new interferometer for the absolute measurement of length standards. The thesis starts with an introduction to the subject of length standards and length measurement by interferometry before considering various designs of interferometer. The design of the new interferometer is given in detail, including the operation of the lasers used as light sources. The alignment of the interferometer and the effects of incorrect alignment and collimation on the measured length are examined. A review of fringe analysis techniques is given, with an emphasis on phase-stepping algorithms. The 5-position algorithm used in the new interferometer is examined in more detail together with the phase-stepping actuator and its advantages over other devices. The data processing of images digitised in the interferometer is described, including the techniques developed for discontinuity removal and surface fitting. The measurement of the flatness and parallelism of the measuring faces of the length standards is described. The automated method of exact fractions is used to combine phase measurements at three wavelengths to allow accurate calculation of the length of the measured object, with a larger range than one or two-wavelength techniques. The techniques used for compensating for the refractive index of the air inside the interferometer chamber are summarised, with a comparison of calculated and directly-measured refractive index values, measured with a specially constructed refractometer. The thermal control of the interferometer is presented, including the use of the instrument to measure the thermal expansion coefficient of length standards, by measuring their lengths at different temperatures. Example results of length, flatness, parallelism, and thermal expansion are given for various sizes of length standard. A full uncertainty budget is calculated, allowing critical examination of the performance of the instrument. A chapter on conclusions is followed by several appendices.},

The role of synchrotron radiation in the generation of coherent x-ray beams is highlighted and the requirements on the source properties are discussed. The technique of phase contrast imaging is briefly explained, aswell as diffraction in the Fresnel and Fraunhofer regimes. The origin of speckle is elucidated and it is shown how oversampling of the diffraction patternby at least a factor oftwo enables retrieval of the phases of the waves scattered from different parts of the object. This in turn allowsfor adirect reconstruction of theobject’s structure. One-dimensional objects, such as afluid confinedbetweentwosurfaces, cannotbeunambiguously reconstructed by phase retrieval without additional assumptions. A trial-and- error method based on the analysis of waveguiding modes within the confined geometry is discussed.},

In this work, a characterization of the first preclinical X-ray phase contrast CT scanner is presented. Two fundamental characteristics of the scanner have been investigated. A series of projection images and CT data sets in phase and attenuation contrast were ac- quired with different acquisition settings of the scanner. Subsequently, the contrast-to-noise ratios of the images were determined and the results for different acquisition settings were compared. The implications for practical imaging purposes were discussed and a recommen- dation for the acquisition settings of future imaging applications is given. In the second part, the spatial system response of the scanner was characterized. Data from direct and indirect measurements of the modulation transfer function of the setup were acquired and analyzed. The maximal resolution of the scanner was estimated by different resolution measures. Finally, a brief example is given to demonstrate how the results of this study can be used to improve the sharpness of the resulting images. I},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a technique for determining the modulation transfer function (MTF) of an imaging system from an experimentally obtained edge profile. The technique includes an exact correction for the frequency passband of the finite-element differentiation required to obtain the line spread function from the edge spread function. This correction has been ignored by investigators in the past and is required whenever finite-element differentiation is used rather than analytic differentiation of a model fitted to the edge response data. The magnitude of the MTF correction is approximately 11\% at f = fc/2 and approximately 57\% at f = fc, where fc = fs/2 is the maximum frequency reproducible without aliasing with a sampling rate of fs. The correction is performed in the spatial frequency domain by multiplying the uncorrected MTF by 1/sinc (pi f/2fc). A computer simulation is presented to demonstrate the effect and the correction procedure. An experimental MTF of an x-ray image intensifier system obtained using this technique is found to be consistent with an MTF obtained using a bar pattern test phantom.},

abstract = {By adding a Talbot-Lau interferometer to a conventional x-ray absorption computed tomography (CT) imaging system, both differential phase contrast (DPC) signal and absorption contrast signal can be simultaneously measured from the same set of CT measurements. The imaging performance of such multi-contrast x-ray CT imaging systems can be characterized with standard metrics such as noise variance, noise power spectrum, contrast-to-noise ratio, modulation transfer function (MTF), and task-based detectability index. Among these metrics, the measurement of the MTF can be challenging in DPC-CT systems due to several confounding factors such as phase wrapping and the difficulty of using fine wires as probes. To address these technical challenges, this paper discusses a viable and reliable method to experimentally measure the MTF of DPC-CT. It has been found that the spatial resolution of DPC-CT is degraded, when compared to that of the corresponding absorption CT, due to the presence of a source grating G0 in the Talbot-Lau interferometer.

abstract = {Since the middle of the 1990s, X-ray phase imaging including phase tomography has been attracting increasing attention. The advantage of X-ray phase imaging is that an extremely high sensitivity is achieved for weak-absorbing materials, such as biological soft tissues, which generate a poor contrast by conventional methods. Medical and biological imaging is the main target of X-ray phase imaging, and several trials using synchrotron radiation sources and laboratory sources have been made. Measuring and controlling the X-ray phase are also significant for X-ray microscopy with a high spatial resolution, and innovative techniques are attracting intense interest. The progress of X-ray phase imaging is supported by the developments in X-ray sources such as third-generation synchrotron radiation sources, optical elements, and image detectors.

abstract = {Synchrotron-radiation-based computed microtomography (SR$\mu$CT) is an established method for the examination of volume structures. It allows to measure the x-ray attenuation coefficient of a specimen three-dimensionally with a spatial resolution of about one micrometer. In contrast to conventional x-ray sources (x-ray tubes), the unique properties of synchrotron radiation enable quantitative measurements that do not suffer from beam-hardening artifacts. During this work the capabilities for quantitative SR$\mu$CTmeasurements have been further improved by enhancements that were made to the SR$\mu$CT apparatus and to the reconstruction chain. For high-resolution SR$\mu$CT an x-ray camera consisting of luminescent screen (x-ray phosphor), lens system, and CCD camera was used. Asignificant suppression of blur that is caused by reflections inside the luminescent screen could be achieved by application of an absorbing optical coating to the screen surface. It is shown that blur and ring artifacts in the tomographic reconstructions are thereby drastically reduced. Furthermore, a robust and objective method for the determination of the center of rotation in projection data (sinograms) is presented that achieves sub-pixel precision. By implementation of this method into the reconstruction chain, complete automation of the reconstruction process has been achieved. Examples of quantitative SR$\mu$CTstudies conducted at the Hamburger Synchrotronstrahlungslabor HASYLAB at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESYare presented and used for the demonstration of the achieved enhancements.},

abstract = {Using a high-efficiency grating interferometer for hard X rays (10-30 keV) and a phase-stepping technique, separate radiographs of the phase and absorption profiles of bulk samples can be obtained from a single set of measurements. Tomographic reconstruction yields quantitative three-dimensional maps of the X-ray refractive index, with a spatial resolution down to a few microns. The method is mechanically robust, requires little spatial coherence and monochromaticity, and can be scaled up to large fields of view, with a detector of correspondingly moderate spatial resolution. These are important prerequisites for use with laboratory X-ray sources.},

@article{Creath1988,
abstract = {This chapter describes the phase-measurement interferometry techniques. For all techniques, a temporal phase modulation is introduced to perform the measurement. By measuring the interferogram intensity as the phase is shifted, the phase of the wavefront can be determined with the aid of electronics or a computer. Phase modulation in an interferometer can be induced by moving a mirror, tilting a glass plate, moving a grating, rotating a half-wave plate or analyzer, using an acousto-optic or electro-optic modulator, or using a Zeeman laser. Phase-measurement techniques using analytical means to determine phase all have some common denominators. There are different equations for calculating the phase of a wavefront from interference fringe intensity measurements. The precision of a phase-measuring interferometer system can be determined by taking two measurements, subtracting them, and looking at the root-meansquare of the difference wavefront. The chapter discusses the simulation results. The elimination of the errors that reduce the measurement accuracy depends on the type of measurement being performed. Phase-measurement interferometry (PMI) can be applied to any two-beam interferometer, including holographic interferometers. Applications can be divided into: surface figure, surface roughness, and metrology.},

abstract = {The modulation transfer function (MTF) of radiographic systems is frequently evaluated by measuring the system's line spread function (LSF) using narrow slits. The slit method requires precise fabrication and alignment of a slit and high radiation exposure. An alternative method for determining the MTF uses a sharp, attenuating edge device. We have constructed an edge device from a 250-microm-thick lead foil laminated between two thin slabs of acrylic. The device is placed near the detector and aligned with the aid of a laser beam and a holder such that a polished edge is parallel to the x-ray beam. A digital image of the edge is processed to obtain the presampled MTF. The image processing includes automated determination of the edge angle, reprojection, sub-binning, smoothing of the edge spread function (ESF), and spectral estimation. This edge method has been compared to the slit method using measurements on standard and high-resolution imaging plates of a digital storage phosphor (DSP) radiography system. The experimental results for both methods agree with a mean MTF difference of 0.008. The edge method provides a convenient measurement of the presampled MTF for digital radiographic systems with good response at low frequencies.},

abstract = {Unsharpness in the image may reduce the visibility of details. Magnification is often required to achieve a spatial resolution similar to film technique, when using digital systems. A part of the unsharpness results from the focal spot size. To determine the effective focal spot size, thousands of images with different tubes, energies, magnifications and IQIs from different EN and ASTM standards were taken to evaluate the influence of the unsharpness in the digital image due to the focal spot. This leads to reference values for the effective focal spot size of the different tubes. These reference values were compared with the values of the pin hole camera images according to EN 12543-2 and they deviated significantly. Several modifications of the evaluation method were proposed and a method with Integrated Line Profiles which produces results like an edge profile method was developed and tested providing similar results as the reference values. A second more simple method for end-users was introduced based on the evaluation of Penetrameter hole edges. A proposed update of the standards for focal spot measurements in ASTM and ISO is introduced. New classes will help the users to identify more simple and reliable the X-ray tube for their application.},

In the following work, we report on the recent development of quantitative descriptions for the stochastic error of grating-based differential phase contrast imaging (DPCi). Our model includes the noise transfer characteristics of the x-ray detector and the jitter of the phase steps. We find that the noise in DPCi depends strongly on the phase stepping visibility and the sample properties. The results are supported by experimental evidence acquired with our new instrument with a field of view of 50×70 mm2. Our conclusions provide general guidelines to optimize grating interferometers for specific applications and problems.},

According to the character of longitudinal periodicity of the interferogram, the setup is insensitive to mechanical drift and vibrations. The effect of temporal coherence of x-ray source is investigated and its related bandwidth is derived. Based on the theory of partially coherent light, it shows that the requirement for the spatial coherence of x-ray source is not strict and can be met by the general microfocus x-ray tube for x-ray differential phase-contrast imaging.},

abstract = {X-ray radiographic absorption imaging is an invaluable tool in medical diagnostics and materials science. For biological tissue samples, polymers or fibre composites, however, the use of conventional X-ray radiography is limited due to their weak absorption. This is resolved at highly brilliant X-ray synchrotron or micro-focus sources by using phase-sensitive imaging methods to improve the contrast. However, the requirements of the illuminating radiation mean that hard-X-ray phase-sensitive imaging has until now been impractical with more readily available X-ray sources, such as X-ray tubes. In this letter, we report how a setup consisting of three transmission gratings can efficiently yield quantitative differential phase-contrast images with conventional X-ray tubes. In contrast with existing techniques, the method requires no spatial or temporal coherence, is mechanically robust, and can be scaled up to large fields of view. Our method provides all the benefits of contrast-enhanced phase-sensitive imaging, but is also fully compatible with conventional absorption radiography. It is applicable to X-ray medical imaging, industrial non-destructive testing, and to other low-brilliance radiation, such as neutrons or atoms.},

abstract = {Imaging with visible light today uses numerous contrast mechanisms, including bright- and dark-field contrast, phase-contrast schemes and confocal and fluorescence-based methods. X-ray imaging, on the other hand, has only recently seen the development of an analogous variety of contrast modalities. Although X-ray phase-contrast imaging could successfully be implemented at a relatively early stage with several techniques, dark-field imaging, or more generally scattering-based imaging, with hard X-rays and good signal-to-noise ratio, in practice still remains a challenging task even at highly brilliant synchrotron sources. In this letter, we report a new approach on the basis of a grating interferometer that can efficiently yield dark-field scatter images of high quality, even with conventional X-ray tube sources. Because the image contrast is formed through the mechanism of small-angle scattering, it provides complementary and otherwise inaccessible structural information about the specimen at the micrometre and submicrometre length scale. Our approach is fully compatible with conventional transmission radiography and a recently developed hard-X-ray phase-contrast imaging scheme. Applications to X-ray medical imaging, industrial non-destructive testing and security screening are discussed.},

abstract = {Grating-based x-ray differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging has shown huge potential. For broad applications, it is essential that the key components are low-cost, especially the absorption gratings.We therefore proposed and developed a micro-casting process for fabricating x-ray absorption gratings with bismuth. This process is feasible for mass production at low cost, with a large format, and a high aspect ratio. To develop this kind of absorption grating, an array with deep trenches was fabricated by photo-assisted electrochemical etching in a silicon wafer. The trenches were then filled with bubble-free, molten bismuth via capillary action and surface tension. Bismuth was attractive as a filling material because of its great mass absorption coefficient, low cost and broad environmental compatibility. Furthermore, our micro-casting process provided bismuth absorption gratings with a clean surface and no need for post treatment. To test their performance in x-ray DPC imaging, two bismuth absorption gratings, one as a periodic source and another as the analyzer, were used with periods of 42 and 3 µm and depths of 110 and 150 µm, respectively. The acquired phase-contrast images demonstrated that the micro-casting process produces qualified gratings for x-ray DPC imaging.},
