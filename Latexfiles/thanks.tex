\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank various people for their help and support during the last year.
First of all, my sincere gratitude belongs to Franz Pfeiffer, who gave me the opportunity to be a part of his group for preparing my thesis and who had always an open ear for helpfully answering my questions.\\

A big thank you goes to Florian Schaff and Friedrich Prade for introducing me to 'their baby' the high resolution X-ray grating interferometer setup, which I hopefully always treated well in their eyes during my thesis. They also got never tired discussing many aspects of my work and providing me helpful material. Last but not least, I would like to thank them for patiently proof reading my thesis and the very helpful comments and their time they took for me.\\

Furthermore, I would thank Johannes Wolf for lining up the AMPTEK and the people from the crystallographic laboratory providing me the well polished knife-edge.\\

Special thanks go to the IMETUM people especially Simone Ferstl, Karin Burger, Jonathan Schock, Pidassa Bidola, Fabio de Marco, Markus Schüttler, Mark Müller and Rico Burkhardt for helping with all kind of issues and the pleasant working atmosphere in the office.\\

A thank you goes also the whole E17 group for a very nice year in the group and also to the people taking care of the IT related issues.\\

Finally, I want to thank my family and my girlfriend for their big support during my whole studies and for always being there for me!
